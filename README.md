# Miruku App

Miruku is an application designed to assist in the management of farms that produce milk. 

The main objective is to introduce technology within the farms in an affordable and easy to handle manner. 

## Internal Features
Miruku App is an API that simply returns json responses, that is, the user interface is completely separate.

Miruku so far manages cows, milk production, medicines and applied vaccines using relational database 

The entire API was developed with [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/), so I would like to extend my deep thanks to the developers of this marvel of micro framework.
